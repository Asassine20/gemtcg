Whether youâ€™re buying Pokemon card singles, sealed products, or shipping supplies, the right card can help you earn cash back, manage cash flow, and even score sign-up bonuses. But with so many options out there, how do you choose? Iâ€™ve done the research (and the math) to bring you the **top 5 credit cards** for online PokÃ©mon TCG resellers. These cards have **no annual fees, low barriers to entry, and high cash back rewards**, which is perfect for anyone who makes a lot of purchases online.

Think about it, if you spend $100,000 on inventory in one year using a 2% cash back credit card, you will earn an extra $2,000. That is $2,000 that you would've never had if you were using a debit card, cash, or other forms of payment. 

Keep in mind, some of these cards may have referral/affiliate links so if you click through the links on this page, you and I will receive extra bonuses (mainly the sign up bonus is the part that gets increased).

Letâ€™s dive in and find the best card to supercharge your reselling hustle!
