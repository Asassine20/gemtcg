Pokémon cards have featured many stunning art styles over the years, but few are as instantly recognizable as Asako Ito’s clay artwork. Instead of drawings or digital illustrations, her cards showcase handcrafted clay Pokémon figures, often set against real-world textures like grass, sand, or fabric. This gives them a playful, almost toy-like aesthetic that collectors adore.  Since her debut in the e-Card era, Asako Ito has created dozens of clay-illustrated Pokémon cards, spanning multiple sets and generations. Some of the most iconic include Clay Pikachu, Ditto Transform Series, and Gengar’s eerie clay form. Whether you’re a seasoned collector or just discovering these charming cards, this list will help you track them all down!
