## **Sourcing Pokemon Bulk**

### **Finding Reliable Sources**

I primarily acquire bulk through **Facebook groups and Facebook Marketplace**. Some groups have over 100,000 members, making them an excellent place to find sellers looking to offload large amounts of bulk. Additionally, reaching out to **local game stores** (LGS) can be beneficial. Many stores focus on singles and sealed products but accumulate bulk they may sell at a discount.

### **Avoiding Scams**

Buying bulk online comes with risks. Here’s how I minimize them:

* **Request photos of the bulk** to verify the seller’s claims.
* **Check their references**, such as their reputation in the group or their history in the Pokemon community.
* **Watch out for oddly specific numbers**, like “4,000 Commons and 4,000 Foils.” These are often red flags.
* **Use secure payment methods**, such as PayPal Goods & Services, to protect yourself from fraudulent transactions.

### **Bulk Buying Strategies**

I differentiate myself by purchasing a variety of rarities. Many buyers focus only on Commons and Uncommons, but I buy **Holo Rares and Ultra Rares**, giving me an edge in securing bulk deals.

## **Processing Pokemon Bulk**

### **Initial Inspection**

When I receive bulk, I quickly evaluate the condition. Damaged or heavily played cards reduce the value, so I sort them separately.

### **Sorting for Value**

I categorize cards into three main groups:

1. **Expensive Trainers and Staples** – Cards used in the competitve scene like **Earth Vessel and Night Stretcher** can be worth $3 each. Identifying and selling these separately boosts profit margins.
2. **Popular Characters** – Pikachu, Charizard, and Gengar tend to sell well, even if they’re just Commons or Uncommons.
3. **General Bulk** – The remaining bulk is stored efficiently and sold in large lots.

I also remove **energy cards and code cards** to prevent clutter and maximize the value of my bulk lots.

## **Selling Pokemon Bulk**

### **Maximizing Profits Through Different Marketplaces**

#### **1. Selling Singles on TCGPlayer**

For valuable trainers and playable cards, **[TCGPlayer](https://tcgplayer.com) is the best platform**. Competitive players frequently purchase singles there, ensuring a steady demand. I recommend listing cards in **sets of four**, as buyers prefer to purchase playsets rather than single copies.

#### **2. Selling Popular Characters on eBay**

Cards featuring **iconic Pokemon** often fetch higher prices on **[eBay](https://ebay.com)** than on TCGPlayer. Casual collectors and gift buyers are willing to pay a premium for their favorite characters.

#### **3. Bulk Lots on eBay and Facebook Marketplace**

Once I’ve pulled out the valuable cards, I sell bulk in **1,000-card lots** on eBay. These lots appeal to collectors looking for a fun experience at a lower cost than booster packs. I ensure transparency by **providing pictures of the actual cards** instead of misleading claims like “one in ten chance of a Charizard.”

## **Storage and Organization Tips**

Managing thousands of bulk cards requires an efficient storage system. I use:

* **Labeled storage boxes** to separate bulk by set and condition.
* **A tracking spreadsheet** to monitor inventory and sales.
* **A dedicated workspace** to prevent misplaced inventory and canceled orders due to missing stock.

## **Should You Sell Bulk?**

Selling bulk can be profitable but is time-consuming. If you have **more time than money**, it’s a great way to build capital. However, if you prefer faster sales, focus on singles and sealed products instead.
