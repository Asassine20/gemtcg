# Is the Pokémon Market Crashing? Here’s What the eBay Data Actually Shows

There’s been a lot of noise lately in the Pokémon TCG community. Talk of a “market crash,” panic selling, and claims that this is the “beginning of the end” for Pokémon cards.

But how much of that is actually true?

In today’s breakdown, I’m going to walk you through **real eBay sales data** to separate fact from fear. Instead of reacting to social media speculation and hype, we’re going to look at what the numbers actually say, and how you can use this moment to your advantage if you’re a collector, reseller, or investor.

## The “Crash” Narrative: What People Are Saying

Over the past few weeks, Pokémon sales have cooled off slightly. You’ve probably seen people online saying that the market is tanking or that it’s time to dump your inventory.

But the truth is, **this isn’t a crash**. It’s a **normal cooldown period**, and in fact, the broader data shows the market remains stable (and even slightly up) over time.

Let’s dig into the numbers.

## Looking at the Data: eBay’s Seller Hub Research Tool

If you sell on eBay, you have access to a powerful tool inside your **Seller Hub**, under **Research → Product Research**. This shows total sales, sold prices, and other useful data.

For this analysis, I searched for **“Pokémon”** under the **Trading Cards** category, filtered to **individual cards only** (no sealed products or bulk lots). Then I looked at total sales over the **past 7, 30, 90, and 180 days**.

## 30-Day and 7-Day Data: Yes, It’s Cooling Slightly

In the last 30 days:

* **Total sold items:** Dropped from around **21,900 to 16,900 per day**, a difference of about 4,000 items.
* **Average sold price:** Stayed **steady around $60–65**.

In the past 7 days, there was also a noticeable dip in daily sales. From **19,600 down to 16,900**.

At a glance, this looks negative, and that’s what’s fueling the “crash” talk. But that’s only part of the picture.

## 90-Day View: Stable and Healthy Growth

When we zoom out to 90 days, the line stabilizes. There’s a small downward movement, but **nothing alarming**, especially when compared to how hot the market has been all year.

Sales are consistently hovering around **18,000 to 20,000 items per day**, which is **essentially flat** compared to three months ago.

In other words, **the Pokémon market hasn’t crashed, it’s just normalizing.**

---

## 6-Month Trend: Still on an Upward Path

Looking back six months, the **average sold prices are actually trending upward**.

Sales volume has been steady, and even with recent dips, it’s higher than it was earlier in the year. The market’s been hot, and frankly, it needed to cool down a bit.

These short-term dips usually come right after hype cycles (think “meme cards” or sudden price spikes in random sets). When those fade, buyers pull back temporarily. That’s normal market behavior, not collapse.

---

## Why the Cooldown Is Actually a Good Thing

A healthy market **needs** cooling periods. When prices rise too quickly, flippers flood the market and buyers lose confidence.

This short cooldown is shaking out the over-leveraged resellers and short-term hype buyers, which is great for long-term collectors and investors.

If you’re operating with **cash on hand**, not credit, you’re in a strong position right now. Sellers are panic-listing items to recoup funds, which means **great buying opportunities** for disciplined investors.

---

## The Holiday Effect: Expect a Strong Rebound

Based on historical eBay data, sales volume always spikes heading into the holidays.

Looking at last year:

* Sales rose from **~85,000 items in October** to **~122,000 in December**.
* Then peaked around **175,000 in February**.

We’re in that same **pre-holiday lull** right now, and if history repeats (which it usually does), **sales will surge again around Black Friday and Cyber Monday**.

So rather than panic selling, this is the time to **stock up on underpriced inventory** and prepare for Q4.

---

## How to Position Yourself Right Now

Here’s how I’m approaching this period, and what I’d recommend:

1. **Buy Smart:** Focus on strong, liquid inventory that consistently sells (popular sets and popular rarities like Special/Illustration Rares).
2. **Avoid Leverage:** Don’t buy inventory with credit or debt unless you can safely hold it long term.
3. **Be Patient:** Even if the rebound takes a few months, the fundamentals of the Pokémon market remain strong.
4. **Stay Consistent:** The biggest mistake sellers make is pulling back when the market dips. Keep buying, listing, and reinvesting.

If you keep that mindset, you’ll outperform most people who react emotionally to short-term data.

## Final Thoughts: This Isn’t the End. It’s the Reset

Despite what you might hear on social media, **the Pokémon TCG market isn’t crashing**. The data shows a brief cooldown, not a collapse.

And for smart investors and resellers, that’s a huge opportunity.

So don’t panic. Use this period to source smart, stay consistent, and prepare for the holiday surge.

If you can stay disciplined while others are fearful, you’ll come out of this stronger than ever.
