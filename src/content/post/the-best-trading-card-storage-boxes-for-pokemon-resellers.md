## Why Every PokÃ©mon Card Reseller Needs Proper Storage Boxes

If youâ€™re serious about reselling PokÃ©mon cards, keeping your inventory organized is **just as important as acquiring new stock**. Having the right storage system ensures your cards stay in **great condition**, are **easily accessible**, and donâ€™t take up unnecessary space.

Please keep in mind that these products do have affiliate links, so if you want to support me and GemTCG, I would love it if you click through the links provided. However, if you are able to find scanners that you think are great at a better price, by all means go for it!

Also, when ordering card storage boxes, it is best to order them in bulk because the price drops significantly. I have found some boxes selling in quantities of 1 for around $25, while certain listings with quantities of 10 or more selling for around $5 per box.
