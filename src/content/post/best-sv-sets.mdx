# Ranking Every Scarlet & Violet Era Set for Long-Term Investment

Hello everyone! It's **Andrew from Gem TCG**, and today we're ranking **every Scarlet & Violet era set** from worst to best for **long-term investment**.  
This list is based on **setlists**, **popular characters**, and **demand for singles**, rather than print runs or sealed product speculation.

---

## 🔟 Scarlet & Violet Base

**Reasoning:**  
Base sets historically underperform compared to later expansions. The setlist is decent but lacks standout cards.  
Top hits like **Gardevoir EX**, **Miriam**, and **Miraidon/Koraidon** never sustained value.

**Verdict:**  
> A foundational set but one of the weakest long-term plays.

---

## 9️⃣ Temporal Forces

Despite a few cool cards like **Raging Bolt EX** and **Gastly**, the set lacks iconic characters.  
Had there been a true **Gengar** feature, it could’ve landed much higher.

**Verdict:**  
> Fun to open, low long-term potential.

---

## 8️⃣ Stellar Crown

Only **five cards over $20**, despite featuring **Squirtle** and **Bulbasaur**.  
No strong *Special Illustration Rares* to drive demand.

**Verdict:**  
> Nostalgia can’t save a weak high-end chase lineup.

---

## 7️⃣ Obsidian Flames

Charizard fatigue strikes again.  
While Charizard EX is the chase, modern Charizard sets like this don’t perform well unless the artwork or form is exceptional (e.g., shiny or unique variants).

**Verdict:**  
> Charizard alone can’t carry this one—expect *Darkness Ablaze*–level performance.

---

## 6️⃣ Paradox Rift

A fun set with solid cards like **Groudon** and **Altaria**, but no major hits or standout special rarities.

**Verdict:**  
> Great collector’s set, but not a strong investment candidate.

---

## 5️⃣ Journey Together

A unique **trainer + Pokémon** concept reminiscent of *Gym Heroes* and *Rising Rivals*.  
Featuring **Lillie**, a proven fan favorite, this set has strong collector appeal.

**Verdict:**  
> Trainer-Pokémon combo sets age well—long-term upside is strong.

---

## 4️⃣ Paldea Evolved

Despite high hype, it’s slightly overrated. The **Magikarp Illustration Rare** feels artificially inflated.  
Still, great cards like **Tyranitar**, **Raichu**, and **Iono** keep it relevant.

**Verdict:**  
> Strong, but hype outweighs fundamentals.

---

## 🥉 3️⃣ Twilight Masquerade

Home to the standout **Greninja Illustration Rare**, currently around **$377**.  
Greninja’s massive popularity ensures future growth. Bonus points for **Eevee** and **Carmine** inclusions.

**Verdict:**  
> Popular Pokémon + great art = excellent long-term growth.

---

## 🥈 2️⃣ Surging Sparks

Featuring **Pikachu**, **Latias**, **Milotic**, and **Latios**, this set is stacked.  
The Pikachu chase alone cements it as one of the best in the era.

**Verdict:**  
> Pikachu power makes this a long-term winner.

---

## 🥇 1️⃣ Destined Rivals

The ultimate Scarlet & Violet main set.  
Built around the **Team Rocket** theme with hits like **Mewtwo**, **Garchomp**, and **Moltres**.  
Combines strong nostalgia, character appeal, and unique concept.

**Verdict:**  
> The best main set investment from the entire era.

---

# Specialty Sets Ranking

## 6️⃣ Shrouded Fable

Cool art but lacks fan-favorite Pokémon. Characters like **Persian** and **Dusclops** can’t carry value.

**Verdict:**  
> Stylish but forgettable.

---

## 4️⃣ Black Bolt & White Flare (Combined)

Impressive special rares with **Reshiram** and **Zekrom**, but limited nostalgia appeal due to the Black & White era’s weaker fanbase.

**Verdict:**  
> Great design, mid-tier demand.

---

## 🥉 3️⃣ Paldean Fates

Includes **Bubble Mew**, potentially the top single of the entire era, alongside a **Shiny Charizard** and **Shiny Pikachu**.  
Massive collector draw.

**Verdict:**  
> Shiny icons make this a must-have specialty set.

---

## 🥈 2️⃣ Prismatic Evolutions

The **Eevee-lution dream set**.  
Dozens of hits, many above $100, and the same energy as *Evolving Skies*.  
A guaranteed long-term favorite.

**Verdict:**  
> The "Evolving Skies" of Scarlet & Violet—exceptional investment.

---

## 🥇 1️⃣ Scarlet & Violet 151

The **foundation of Pokémon nostalgia**.  
Features the original 151 lineup, now in a dedicated set. Early low print runs have made sealed boxes explode in value.

**Verdict:**  
> Timeless. The single best Scarlet & Violet era investment.

---

# 🏆 Overall Top 3 Sets

| Rank | Set Name | Type | Why It Wins |
|------|-----------|------|--------------|
| 🥇 1 | **Scarlet & Violet 151** | Specialty | Pure nostalgia + foundational lineup |
| 🥈 2 | **Prismatic Evolutions** | Specialty | Massive collector appeal via Eeveelutions |
| 🥉 3 | **Destined Rivals** | Main | Team Rocket theme, iconic characters |

---

## Final Thoughts

Whether you’re investing or collecting, the **Scarlet & Violet era** offers plenty of opportunity.  
While not all sets will perform equally, sets rich in **nostalgia, iconic Pokémon, and standout art** will always have staying power.
