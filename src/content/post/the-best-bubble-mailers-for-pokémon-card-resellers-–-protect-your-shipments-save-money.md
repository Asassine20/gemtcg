* **8x4 Bubble Mailer:** Ideal for **orders of up to 50 cards**. This size provides just enough space for a toploader or a small team bag without excess bulk.

### 3. **Quality Matters â€“ Protection, Size, and Seal Strength**

When selecting bubble mailers, **quality is everything**. Hereâ€™s what to look for:

* **Protection:** A good bubble mailer should have **adequate padding** to absorb impact and protect your cards from rough handling.
* **Actual Usable Size:** Some mailers claim a certain size but have interior dimensions much smaller than expected. Always check the **inner measurements** before purchasing.
* **Seal Strength:** A weak adhesive seal can open during transit, putting your order at risk. Choose mailers with **strong, tamper-proof seals** to ensure safe delivery.
